# Search Engine Tricks

- These tricks are useful (many of these) in all the browsers or search engines.

### Asking the Right Questions

#### Be Thoughtful

- Begin with a simple query
- Be precise
- Avoid redundant or unnecessary terms
- Break your query down into smaller questions

#### Watch your words

- Every word is meaningful

  - Terms matter
  - Order matter

- Google does not care about:

  - Spelling
  - Punctuation
  - Capitalization

### Think Critically

- Find several perspectives
- See when content was written and where it's sourced from

  - Does this make sense?
  - Is this source reputable?
  - Are there reviews for this site?

- Don't trust everything on forums
- Be skeptical: ask yourself questions about results
- Search result rankings are not indicative of accuracy
- Verify with multiple sources when possible

> Typing **do a barrel roll** makes Google do a 360 no-scope somersault, We can also acheive the same effect by typing **z or r twice**.
> We can tilt our search engine results page by searching **askew**.

## Search Operators

- By putting _double quotes_ around a term we can **force Search Engine** to search it only.
- Eg:- "React Projects" etc.

#### Matching Operators

- **Exact("")**,
- **Exclusion(-)**,
- **Wildcard(\*)**,
- **AROUND(X)** - For searching results around given value of _X_

#### Date Operators

- Pattern - `yyyy-mm-dd`
  - **BEFORE:**
  - **AFTER:**
  - **range(#...#)** - date in range(2022...2023)

> ellipsis(...) can also be used for numbers (eg:- tutorial 5...10 hours long by freecodecamp)

#### Source Operators

> `https://www.google.com/advanced_search` can be used for advance search query.
